       <h3>How to make it</h3>
        <p>Nothing says down-home comfort quite like shrimp and grits. Bold, peppery gravy, succulent seafood, and rich sausage create a bite that's too perfect not to make. Learn how to create a restaurant-quality brunch dish in a few simple steps and have a deliciously hearty Lowcountry meal in no time.

            The Best Grits for Shrimp and Grits
            When it comes to selecting your grits, quality is key. While the 5-minute variety offers convenience, stone-ground grits provide an authentic texture that can't be substituted. One part grits to 4 parts liquid is the fuss-free ratio that gets deliciously creamy results every time.
            
            Add water, salt, and milk to a standard-sized pot (use half-and-half for an even richer result) and allow the mixture to come to a simmer before whisking in the grits. Gently stir, allowing the grits to come back to a gentle bubbling, then lower the heat and cover until fully cooked.
